# Computer-Vision-_-POC-_-Object-detection-with-Mask-RCNN
Project 7 of Machine Learning course of OpenClassroom. Powerpoint presentation and pdf report of a 'state of the art' of current computer vision existing algorithms, and first implementation of a mask RCNN algorithm.


As a first approach in this domain, I decide here to explore the various algorithms existing in the computer vision field, entering into details about object detection and classification in an image, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation.

I then focused on Mask-RCNN algorithm, which is an 'instance segmentation' algorithm, and decided to implement and adapt the Matterport version. Original code from Matterport is available here : https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
